## Abstract

The main purpose of this work in general is to expand amount of known amiloid forming peptides. This may help to improve  prediction quality of amilodigensity predictors. On this step our tusk was to develop algorithm of searching of short amiloid motifs obtained from Waltz-DB in peptide sequences from DisProt. In DisProt presented sequences which are partly or fully unstructured, so this let us suppose that motifs in this regions will aggregate with higher chances, then same motifs in structured parts of peptide. Also, we're studied only peptides which are shorter than 1000 residues to prevent affection of other part of peptide on amiloid rigeon.   
# The main goal og the project 

##### to find amiloid forming sequences in peptides which is represent in *Disprot DB*

## Tasks

- To find the way to get sequences no longer then 1000 residuce out of Disprot DB
- To find in this sequences amilod-forming regions (this date may be obtained from Waltz DB)
- To create final file with amiloid-forming peptides
